# EEG-Classification
This repository contains the code for a project for EE-C247 at UCLA. 
For this project, I explored the performances of different neural networks. 
I investigated the effects of cascading RNNs after CNNs, and the effects that windowing data augmentation techniques have on classifying EEG signal samples.
